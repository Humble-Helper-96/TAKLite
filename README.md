## This fork: custom maps and data import

This fork adds your own map sources, such as TileServer GL
(`https://host.com/styles/mapName/512/{z}/{x}/{y}.png`), offline map download,
and import of TAK data packages, KML, KMZ and GPX to TAK Lite 1.5.0.
Upstream no longer publishes the app's source, so the features are built on top
of the official release APK. See [mod/README.md](mod/README.md) for how to use
and build it.
